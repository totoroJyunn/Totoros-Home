## Contributors

“Contributors” here does not simply mean people who stayed overnight, 
nor does it mean residents in a formal sense.

It refers to those who chose to live here with initiative — 
people who acted with care, helped maintain the space, 
and contributed in their own ways, rather than merely consuming what was provided.
